# Human_Migration_Analysis

When we consider data analysis and machine learning, we usually discover it beneficial for business applications. However both have immense potential to assist in the resolution of a wide range of issues. The aim of the project is to offer a machine learning solution for a problem that falls under the category Human Migration. Human Migration Analysis refers to the interpretation of patterns and factors related to the movement of people from one geographical location to another. The project's main goal is to preprocess datasets, and develop a machine learning model to classify a country's net human migration rate as positive or negative. The methodology involves data pre-processing, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, neural networks.
This project holds significance because these types of solutions are not widely available for organizations dedicated to handling human migration. The primary cause of this situation is, the organizations dedicated to migrant issues usually lack in economic resources and professionals in this field usually lack training and experience in Machine Learning. The implications of this research extend beyond academic interest, offering practical applications for governments, international organizations, and researchers seeking a deeper understanding of human migration phenomena.
